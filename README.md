# Capstone 3 JerryBee Bakery React App

This was my submission as my capstone 3 project for my bootcamp at Zuitt.

I had a lot of fun making and creating the react app. We were only required to make an MVP. And I think I might add more functionalities in the future and make the site more responsive.

The app is based on a business by my fiancee's family. The pictures were AI generated and prompted by me. In the future, I will look into Multer so I can store the image data into MongoDB. As of now, the images are stored in my personal google drive and are being lazy loaded. One link is a Low Quality Image Placeholder, while the other is a main resolution one.

Overall, the process was overall fun and I hope its pleasing to you as well.
