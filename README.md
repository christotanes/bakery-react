This was my submission as my capstone 3 project for my bootcamp at Zuitt.

I had a lot of fun making and creating the react app. We were only required to make an MVP. And I think I might add more functionalities in the future and make the site more responsive.

The app is based on a business by my fiancee's family. The pictures were AI generated and prompted by me. In the future, I will look into Multer so I can store the image data into MongoDB. As of now, the images are stored in my personal google drive and are being lazy loaded. One link is a Low Quality Image Placeholder, while the other is a main resolution one.

When I decided to publish the app to Render, I used dotenv and dotenv vault to store the secrets of the app. Dotenv vault, as the developer mentioned, added an extra layer of security for the secrets of the app.

Overall, the process was overall fun and I hope its pleasing to you as well.
